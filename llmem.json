    "content": "A completely independent LLM memory management system in any repository can be implemented with just a single script (like llmem.sh) and some instructions in the workspace rules. No complex infrastructure, databases, or additional dependencies needed - just a simple bash script using jq and grep for JSON manipulation and search, storing memories in a JSON file.",
